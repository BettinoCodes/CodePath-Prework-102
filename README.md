## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge that I faced was getting used to using javascript again after focusing on python heaivily for projects for for the last couple of months, getting used to the syntax took a while for me to get used to it. I did also kind of stuggled with understanding the DOM concept again but with practice, errors and code tweaks, I was able to be more comforatable with it.
